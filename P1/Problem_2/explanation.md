# Problem 2 - P2_File_Recursion

  ## For this problem I'm using a list to store the pathnames that match our query and I'm using recursion function to traverse through each folder.

  ### Time complexity

    - Worst Case Complexity: O(n) - run time will scale linerly as the number of files and directories increases.

  ### Space complexity

    - Worst Case Complexity: O(n) - same as time complexity the size of our list will increase accordingly to the number of files.
