# Problem 2 - P2_File_Recursion

  ## For this problem I'm using a list to store the pathnames that match our query and I'm using recursion function to traverse through each folder.

  ### Time complexity

    - Worst Case Complexity: O(n) - since we have to traverse through every directory and subdirectory the time complexity will be linear depending on the number of folders there are.

  ### Space complexity
