# Problem 4 - Dutch_National_Flag

  ## To solve this problem I'm using two pointer to make sure we are swapping the 0 and 2 in the correct position.
  
  ### Time complexity
    - O(n) since we are traversing the array once.

  ### Space complexity
    - The space complexity is O(1) since we are performing operations in place and calling the function in a single stack frame.
